# pack2
1D and 2D bin packing engines

The one dimansional packer uses dynamic programming algorithms.  It supports unbounded packing, 0-1 packing, and packing to closest to bin capacity, even if slightly over.

The two dimensional packer uses greedy algorithms to give close to optimal results.  It is aimed at stock cutting problems with guillotine cuts.

The packDemo application provides demos of some of the packing engines' simpler features, and the code shows how to use the engines in a particular application.
