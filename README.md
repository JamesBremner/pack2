# pack2
1D and 2D bin packer

The one dimansional packer uses dynamic programming algorithms.  It supports unbounded packing, 0-1 packing, and packing to closest to bin capacity, even if sloghtly over.

The two dimensional packing uses greedy algorithms to give close to optimal results with guilloting cuts.
